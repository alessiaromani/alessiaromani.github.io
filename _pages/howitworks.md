<h4>RepMat.</h4>
<h5><i><b>Rep</b>licating <b>Mat</b>erials Library.</i></h5>
<br>

The name, <b>RepMat</b>, is an explicit inspiration of the `RepRap` project, [Replicating Rapid prototyper](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap). This initiative aims to making accessible and freely available self-replicable Open-source 3D printers.

In the same way, <b>RepMat</b> wants to democratize materials knowledge and experience by sharing experimentations, results, and possible real exploitations dealing with `circular materials` and `digital fabrication tools`. Inspired by the Makers' community, <b>RepMat</b> encourages connections at a <i>glocal</i> level, acting as a distributed networks linking local communities working on these topics.

<b>RepMat</b> aims to provoke the audience of this library by highlighting the role of dissemination and knowledge transfer in fostering the use of emerging sustainable practices, as well as the development of new ones.

<h5><i>Materials Library <b>System</b>.</i></h5>
<br>

As the name suggests, <b>RepMat</b> derives from the concept of `"Materials Library"`, which means physical collections of material samples to be used during the design process of new products or artifacts.

<b>RepMat</b> is also a system-oriented experiential tool made of two main parts: a `Physical Library` and a `Virtual Library`. The first part collects flat samples, cut-offs, and possible applications, whereas the second part comprises intangible contents such as technical data, information, pictures. The two parts are designed to be used together and are linked in their structure. However, they can be used separately, for example to familiarize with the topic.

<b>RepMat</b> is an Open-Source:
* `Physical` and `Virtual` experiential tool, merging the two fruitions to support the whole experience and knowledge transfer.
- `Local` and `Distributed` network, linking local communities and users in global virtual networks.
+ `Accessible` and `Participated` environment, sharing materials knowledge and encouraging practical actions, as well as collaborations between users.
