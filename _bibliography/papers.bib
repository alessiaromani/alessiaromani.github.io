  title={Biomass waste materials through extrusion-based additive manufacturing. A systematic literature review},
  author={Romani, Alessia and Suriano, Raffaella and Levi, Marinella},
  abstract={Circular economy and bioeconomy models have increasingly spread the principles of sustainable development through different strategies such as reuse and recycling. Biomass waste and by-products are often considered valuable resources. Digital technologies, i.e., extrusion-based additive manufacturing, may potentially foster their exploitation as new materials, although the current framework has not been clearly defined yet. This work wants to systematically review the publications focused on new materials from biomass waste or by-products for extrusion-based additive manufacturing processes. The current situation was analyzed on 69 selected works from 2016 searched on Scopus and WoS, focusing on the different raw materials, new 3D printable materials, 3D printing processes, and potential applications. Afterward, the emerging trends were highlighted through selected best practices from the design practice and industrial sectors. Despite the significant development of thermoplastic reinforced materials, i.e., PLA-filled composites, a wide range of biomass waste and by-products have been studied, especially for small format low-cost Fused Filament Fabrication. Although the academic field may be less focused on exploiting these new circular materials, the interest in new applications is increasing within the design practice and industrial sectors, fostering new synergies within bioeconomy and circular economy contexts.},

  title={Material Library System for Circular Economy. Tangible-Intangible Interaction for Recycled Composite Materials},
  author={Romani, Alessia and Prestini, Fabio and Suriano, Raffaella and Levi, Marinella},
  abstract={Currently the development of new circular materials has brought up the necessity to transfer their knowledge amongst the interested stakeholders for their real exploitation. This chapter aims to illustrate the design of a physical and virtual library system of the FiberEUse project. In particular, this library system wants to foster the development of new applications and value chains through the showcase of the new recycled composite materials and archetypal remanufactured products developed during the project. After the definition of the system concept, specific taxonomies were designed for the physical and virtual parts considering the technical properties and the expressive-sensorial qualities of the new recycled materials and products. A hierarchical organization was then designed to allow both tangible and intangible interactions with the samples, resulting in a coherent experience to explore these new recycled materials. Meanwhile, the physical exhibitors and the library website were developed to collect the physical and virtual samples. At the end, the whole system will be freely accessible through the library website and by booking a visit to the physical part. Thanks to its transdisciplinary nature, this system can stimulate the real exploitation of new value chains and applications.},

  title={Design, Materials, and Extrusion-Based Additive Manufacturing in Circular Economy Contexts. From Waste to New Products},
  author={Romani, Alessia and Rognoli, Valentina and Levi, Marinella},
  abstract={The transition toward circular economy models has been progressively promoted in the last few years. Different disciplines and strategies may significantly support this change. Although the specific contribution derived from design, material science, and additive manufacturing is well-established, their interdisciplinary relationship in circular economy contexts is relatively unexplored. This paper aims to review the main case studies related to new circular economy models for waste valorization through extrusion-based additive manufacturing, circular materials, and new design strategies. The general patterns were investigated through a comprehensive analysis of 74 case studies from academic research and design practice in the last six-year period (2015â€“2021), focusing on the application fields, the 3D printing technologies, and the materials. Further considerations and future trends were then included by looking at the relevant funded projects and case studies of 2021. A broader number of applications, circular materials, and technologies were explored by the academic context, concerning the practice-based scenario linked to more consolidated fields. Thanks to the development of new strategies and experiential tools, academic research and practice can be linked to foster new opportunities to implement circular economy models.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
